# CODSOFT-
This project was developed as a part of my C++ Programming Internship at CodSoft. Throughout the internship, I worked on various C++-based tasks and projects that helped me strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming, data structures, and problem-solving using C++.

The main objective of this project was to apply core C++ concepts in a practical way and build a working solution to a real-world problem. It allowed me to enhance my logical thinking, write clean and efficient code, and understand the importance of proper code structure and documentation.

This internship has been a valuable experience, giving me exposure to industry-level practices and boosting my confidence in C++ development.
